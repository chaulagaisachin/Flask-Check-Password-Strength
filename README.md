# Flask-Check-Password-Strength
* This code defines a Flask web application with a single endpoint (/check-password-strength) that accepts a POST request with a password in the request body.
* It also checks the password strength using the logic described in the previous answer, and then returns the password strength score in the response body. 
* This API can be deployed to a web server or cloud platform, and then called by client-side applications or users who want to check the strength of a password.
